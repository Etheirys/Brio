# Brio
Brio is a suite of tools to enhance your GPosing experience.
Brio is currently in alpha, and as such, there may be bugs. If you find any, please report them.

## Features
* Actor Posing
  * While animating
  * Adjust actor positions without them resetting
  * Overlay and graphical posing modes
* Creation and Deletion of GPose actors (up to 39)
* Edit Actor Appearances
* Change the Penumbra collection applied to GPose actors
* Add/Remove/Blend animations on GPose actors (and adjust their speed)
* Change the active festivals and apply up to 4 at once (Moonfire Faire for fireworks etc) 
* Add/Remove Status Effects on GPose actors
* Control Time/Weather in both the Overworld and GPose
* Redraw control of GPose actors
* NPC Appearance Hack (Allows you to apply NPC appearances to players without breaking tools like Penumbra)
* Works with Ktisis and Anamnesis (Enable Brio integration within Anamnesis for a better experience)
