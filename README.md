# Brio
Brio is a suite of tools to enhance your GPosing experience.

## Features

  * Adjust actor positions without them resetting
  * Overlay and graphical posing modes

* Add/Remove Status Effects on GPose actors
* Control Time/Weather in both the Overworld and GPose
* Redraw control of GPose actors
