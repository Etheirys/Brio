      It's been over a year now that I've been the developer & maintainer for Brio.

      Thank you to everyone who uses Brio, supports it monetarily, contributes with code, requests features, 
      reports bugs, or simply engages with the community.
      I'm truly grateful for all the wonderful people I have met over the past year.

      This last year has been the hardest of my life. Without all of you, and without Brio,
      it would have been much worse, so again, Thank You!

      But there is one in particular whom I have met I wish to make a message for, 

      I started talking to you to simply ask you what the color of your sky was, 
      what I found was a sky full of beautiful colors, colors I couldn't stop looking at, 
      colors I fell in love with, colors I wish never to forget.
      I told you I'll give you stars and the moon and a soul to guide you 
      and a promise I'll never go, I mean it now more then ever.

      So, while it is not mine to give necessary, 
      I want to give you the only thing else I know to give you,
      I dedicate Brio to you

      I love you, forever unto eternity~
